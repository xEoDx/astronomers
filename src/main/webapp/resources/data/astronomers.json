    "description": "Pythagoras of Samos was an Ionian Greek philosopher, mathematician, and the putative founder of the movement called Pythagoreanism. The Pythagorean astronomical system positions that the Earth, Moon, Sun and planets revolve around an unseen \"Central Fire\".\n\nWhile the earth and planets revolved around a central point in Philolaus's system, his could not be called a Heliocentric \"solar system\", because the central point the Earth and Planets revolved around was not the Sun, but the so-called Central Fire. This Fire was not visible from the surface of Earth—or at least not from the hemisphere Greece was located in."

He was a man of learning, becoming the chief librarian at the Library of Alexandria. He invented the discipline of geography, including the terminology used today. \n\nHe is best known for being the first person to calculate the circumference of the Earth. His calculation was remarkably accurate. He was also the first to calculate the tilt of the Earth's axis. Additionally, he may have accurately calculated the distance from the Earth to the Sun and invented the leap day. He created the first map of the world, incorporating parallels and meridians based on the available geographic knowledge of his era."

    "description": "Tycho Brahe was a Danish nobleman known for his accurate and comprehensive astronomical and planetary observations. His observations were some five times more accurate than the best available observations at the time.\n\nAlthough Tycho admired Copernicus and was the first to teach his theory in Denmark, he was unable to reconcile Copernican theory with the basic laws of Aristotelian physics, that he considered to be foundational. Instead Tycho Brahe proposed a \"geo-heliocentric\" system in which the Sun and Moon orbited the Earth, while the other planets orbited the Sun. "

Galileo also worked in applied science and technology, inventing an improved military compass and other instruments."

A key figure in the 17th century scientific revolution, he is best known for his laws of planetary motion, where he ensures that planets form an ellipse movement around the sun. This means an improved version of the Copernicus system. Kepler used Tycho's astronomical observations to verify his mathematical model to describe planets motion. \n\nAdditionally, he did fundamental work in the field of optics, invented an improved version of the refracting telescope (the Keplerian telescope), and was mentioned in the telescopic discoveries of his contemporary Galileo Galilei."

    "description": "Sir Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, astronomer, and physicist who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the scientific revolution. \n\nBy deriving Kepler's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity, and then using the same principles to account for the trajectories of comets, the tides, the precession of the equinoxes, and other phenomena, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the Solar System and demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles.\n\n Additionally, Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the colours of the visible spectrum."

He founded the Uppsala Astronomical Observatory in 1741, and in 1742 proposed the Celsius temperature scale which bears his name. \n\nIn astronomy, Celsius began a series of observations using colored glass plates to record the magnitude (a measure of brightness) of certain stars. This was the first attempt to measure the intensity of starlight with a tool other than the human eye. He made observations of eclipses and various astronomical objects and published catalogues of carefully determined magnitudes for some 300 stars using his own photometric system (mean error=0.4 mag)"

    "description": "Lacaille was a French astronomer and priest. His desire to determine the distances of the planets trigonometrically, using the longest possible baseline, led him to propose, in 1750, an expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nThe primary result of his two-year stay was a catalogue of nearly 10,000 southern stars, the production of which required observing every night for over a year. In the course of his survey he took note of 42 nebulous objects. He also achieved his aim of determining the lunar and solar parallaxes (Mars serving as an intermediary).  Apart from constructing astronomical ephemerides and mathematical tables, he calculated a table of eclipses for 1800 years."

    "description": " Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist. His Special Theory of Relativity, proposed in 1905, extended Newtonian Mechanics to very large speeds close to the speed of light. It describes the changes in measurements of physical phenomena when viewed by observers who are in motion relative to the phenomena. \n\nIn 1915, Einstein extended this further in the General Theory of Relativity, which includes the effects of gravitation. According to this theory, mass and energy determine the geometry of spacetime, and curvatures of spacetime manifest themselves in gravitational forces."

Hubble's Law implies that the universe is expanding."

He is a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics."
